tilde fenced code `css` as in example

~~~ css
selector {
  prop: value;
}
~~~

tilde fenced code (no lang)

~~~
just
  pre
    formatted
      text
~~~

it appears line breaks are important for code blocks to be rendered correctly.
test a backtick code blocks

```css
selector {
  prop: value;
}
```

```
just
  pre
    formatted
      text
```

now test if `r` highlighting works

```r
library(ggplot2)
fun = function(x) { identity(x) }
```
